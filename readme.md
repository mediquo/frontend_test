# Mediquo Frontend Test
Our team has been assigned with a task to create a tool for the Quality Service Team. In order to ensure the quality and professionality of our service, this team will review every interaction that has been flagged in our chat and review it. This team needs a chat shell, that has a list of chats to review, can view the conversation detail of each one of them, and can perform an OK/KO action (locally).
